# Phonebook for snom phones

## Purpose

Backend for snom phones to query various data sources by using the
minibrowser-feature. Expandable with own handler plugins. Licensed
under a BSD-2-Clause License.

## Quick-Start

To run this application, you need at least a JRE, or better an up and
running leiningen installation. For information about running clojure
projects, see https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

Copy the example-configuration.clj and make it fitting your needs.

    cp example-configuration.clj configuration.clj
    $EDITOR configuration.clj

Run with `lein run` if you have installed leiningen.

If you don't want to care about leiningen and clojure, use the
provided jar and execute it with

    java -jar snom-phonebook-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

You need to have a configuration.clj staying in the directory from
where you called `java -jar ...`.

To configure your snom phone to make it use of this application, see
http://wiki.snom.com/Category:HowTo:Minibrowser#Keypad-_Triggered and
put in the input field whatever you putted in your configuration as
*base-url*.

## Handlers

### LdapHandler

Queries an existing LDAP Server. Searches in the "cn"-field and
returns the phone-number from "telephoneNumber".

Parameters:

* *server* – IP or Hostname for the LDAP Server
* *basedn* – base dn for search
* *prefix* – prefix to add to retrieved phone numbers

**Example:**

    {:type :ldap
     :server "ldap://ldap.virginia.edu"
     :basedn "o=University of Virginia,c=US"
     :prefix "0"}

### MySQLHandler

Queries a MySQL-Database. You can define from which fields the
name-string is built.

Parameters:

* *database-configuration*
  * classname – com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
  * subprotocol – mysql
  * subname – //ip-or-hostname:port/databasename
  * user
  * password
* *table* – where the data is stored
* *prefix* – prefix to add to retrieved phone numbers
* *name_elements* – list with all needed columns to build the name-string
* *search_elements* – list with elements in which columns should be searched (e.g. name and first name)
* *phone_element* – string with name of the column with the phone number
* *string* – formatstring (actually a vector), from which the name-string will be built.  write down the column name to print the content of that column. write "!str" to write "str" into that string.  write ">str" to write str, if a record comes before the next static ("!..") element useful e.g. to seperate first and last name by a comma only if there is a forename.

**Example:**

    {:type :mysql
     :database-configuration
     {:classname "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
      :subprotocol "mysql"
      :subname "//localhost:3306/groupoffice"
      :user "go"
      :password "x"}
     :table "ab_contacts"
     :name-elements ["first_name" "middle_name" "last_name"]
     :search-elements ["first_name" "last_name"]
     :phone-element "work_phone"
     :format ["last_name" ">, " "first_name" "> " "middle_name" "! (Work) (" "work_phone" "!)"]
     :prefix "0"}

### FlatfileHandler

Parses a file with regexp for name and number and returns them.

Parameters:

* *file* – filename to parse
* *regular-expression* – regular expression which returns two strings out of a line. examples see below
* *name-field* – column-id for phone number
* *number-field* – column-id for phone number
* *prefix* – prefix to add to retrieved phone numbers

**Example for parsing asterisk voicemail-config:**

    {:type :flatfile
     :regular-expression #"^(\d+) => \d*\,([^,]+)?,"
     :file "/etc/asterisk/voicemail-voiceboxes.conf"
     :prefix "0"
     :number-field 0
     :name-field 1}

To use this, you have to outsource the voicebox-config from the
voicemail.conf:

    (...)
    
    [default]
    #include /etc/asterisk/voicemail-voiceboxes.conf

Format for voicemail-voiceboxes.conf is:

    101 => 1234,User A,user-a@example.com
    102 => 1234,User B,user-b@example.com,user-b-notify@example.com
